## Description
This is a versatile e-commerce application, which can be used to provide easy, mobile shopping experience to the consumers.

## Implementation
- ### Firebase based authentication
- ### Categorisation of products
- ### New, innovative social shopping features
- ### Simple, fast to use UI

## Our ideas
We decided to provide a more social, collaborative shopping experience, where the user can involve their friends into the shopping experience, with the help of these two features:

- ### Gift a product to someone, with help of your friends
    You can plan a gift with your friends, and pool money together. Your friends can contribute a part of the money towards the gift, and send a custom message as well. This makes gifting as a group much easier, as we can also provide a feature to add a greeting card to the receiver at the time of delivery.
    __For example: This feature can be used by students to collect money and gift a nice product to their teacher.__

- ### Ask your friends what they think of a product, get their feedback on what you are planning to buy
    Like in real-life shopping experiences, you can ask your friends about their feedback of a product, and the app will send them information about the product you are talking about. They can then vote, and offer feedback on the product which will be sent back to you. This way you can include people in your shopping experience, even if they are miles away.
    __For example: You can ask your family members what they would like you to buy, even if they are not physically near your location.__
